# CMCM-18-submission
2018 submission (11/12/18) for **Cornell's Mathematical Contest in Modeling.** Retroactive push to Github.

Abridged contest prompt: Optimize ambulance deployment locations in Ithaca, NY for fast response and arrival at scene. 

My first time participating in a mathematical modeling contest. Submissions expected 3 days after the prompt's public release. We received positive feedback but our paper was not awarded, like those in the top 3. :cry:
