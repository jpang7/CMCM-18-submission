# CMCM-18-submission
2018 submission (11/12/18) for **Cornell's Mathematical Contest in Modeling.** Retroactive push to Github.

Highly abridged contest prompt: Optimize ambulance parking/deployment locations in Ithaca, NY for fast response and arrival at scene. 

Submissions were expected 3 days after the prompt's public release. We received positive feedback but our paper was not awarded, like those in the top 3.
